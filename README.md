## Summary:

In conclusion, data suggests that surf and ice cream shop business are sustainable year-round in Ohau, Hawaii. The weather in both months roughly falls between 70- 75 degrees making it feasible to open up shops all year round.

One additional query that would be useful to his plan is to gather more data on foot traffic analysis near the location to see if it is a popular location to open in. Another additional query would be to gather more weather data for June and December from previous years and compare the data to get a more accurate analysis.
